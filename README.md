# FMCG-Supply-Chain-Inventory-Optimization
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse. â€¢ Also try to analysis the demand pattern in different pockets of the country so management can drive the advertisement campaign particular in those pockets.

A FMCG company has entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher
management has notices that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the
demand is high, supply is pretty low and where the demand is low, supply is pretty high. In
both the ways it is an inventory cost loss to the company; hence, the higher management wants
to optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in entire country.
